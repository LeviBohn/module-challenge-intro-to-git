## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a language or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? a version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a collection of commands. GitHub is a 'cloud' where history of code is stored.
3. Why do we create a branch? So that we can make changes to be reviewed without disturbing the main branch unnecessarily.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to submit contributions to be reviewed, edited, and eventually submitted into the project as a whole.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git branch -M main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' downloads (fetches) a branch from another repository
'git merge' ties together (merges) your current branch with another branch
'git pull' FETCHES a branch from a remote repository AND immediately MERGES it into the current branch
7. What is a merge conflict? when competing changes are made to the same line of a file
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? pull the changes to your local repository and correct the changes there
